# RestaurantManagementSystem

This system keeps track of the customers who have visited a restaurant.
The customers are prioritized on the first-come-first-serve basis. Hence,the concept of queues has been used for entry and exit of customers.
The concept of stacks has been used to keep a record of the customers who have left the restaurant.
